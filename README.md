## Introduction

A Collection of cross-platform C++ Code for OpenGL and Graphics.

So far, we have basic Linux and OSX support and hopefully, I'll have Windows support in the near future.

## Aims

* Fast deployment of OpenGL Applications
* Clean & modern C++ code
* Speed
* Adherence to the latest OpenGL standard
* No fixed pipeline functions
* Easily linked with PCL, OpenCV and more, whilst remaining decoupled
* Ease of use
* Good documentation and examples

## Features

* Combines GLFW, GLEW and GLM for a fully featured OpenGL experience
* Attempts to be quite decoupled; you can use as much or as little as you want.
* Built around CMake rather than XCode or Codeblocks, because, quite frankly, it is superior and less hassle in the long run. 
* Similar to Cinder in using the Shared Object Model
