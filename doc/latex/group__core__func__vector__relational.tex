\-Relational and equality operators ($<$, $<$=, $>$, $>$=, ==, !=) are defined to operate on scalars and produce scalar \-Boolean results. \-For vector results, use the following built-\/in functions.

\-In all cases, the sizes of all the input and return vectors for any particular call must match.
